# Titanic---Machine-Learning-from-Disaster

## Titanic Survival Prediction

This project explores the Titanic dataset, performing data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model building to predict passenger survival based on various features. Three models are trained and evaluated: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Classifier.
